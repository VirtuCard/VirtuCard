# VirtuCards
**CS 30700 Course Project for Spring 2021**

In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, social distancing policies were implemented in public areas, which limited physical interaction and some social activities. One of these activities is playing card games with friends. In real-world situations, the card deck and other surfaces become points of contact between players. VirtuCards is a mobile game for groups of friends to play card games, along with a desktop game to act as shared common screen. Includes additional features such as leaderboards, custom avatars, private messaging, custom cardbacks, song requests and animated reactions. Built with Unity along with Google Firebase for account management and Photon for multiplayer gameplay.
